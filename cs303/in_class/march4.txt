two parts to heap sort
  1. build the max heap. Claim: this can be done with fewer than N swaps
  2. swap(1, N)
     N -= 1
     sift_down(1)  requires N(lg N) or fewer

special case (even the bottom level is complete of step 1 above)

    X       N == 1  nl = 1  n_swaps = 0
==============
    X       N == 3  nl = 2  n_swaps = 1
 Y     Z
==============
    A             N == 7  nl = 3   n_swaps = 4
  B         C
D   E    F     G

S(nl): A complete tree, even the bottom level, with nl levels
       needs at most N - nl swaps to make it into a max-heap

prove:
if S(nl - 1) is true (previous case), then S(nl) is also true.
the tree below has nl levels.
              A                   num nodes N = 1 + N_left + N_right
    B                 C
 .    .             .   .
........           .......
N_left              N_right             num nodes
nl - 1              nl - 1              num levels
N_left - (nl - 1)   N_right - (nl - 1)  max num swaps

additional swaps to sift node A down  nl - 1

total = N_left + N_right - 2(nl - 1) + nl - 1
total = N_left + N_right - (nl - 1)
total = N_left + N_right - nl + 1
total = N - nl

consider the left subtree of A and the right subtree of A
the subtrees have nl - 1 levels
