a graph, G = (V, E)     V is a set of vertices (points)
                        E is a set of edges that connect points.
                        edges connect vertices

Computer representation of Graphs

1) incidence matrix
      (1 means the edge and vertex touch)

    e0 e1 e2 e3
v0  1  1  1  1
v1  0  0  1  1
v2  1  0  0  0

incid = [
            [1, 1, 1, 1],
            [0, 0, 1, 1],
            [1, 0, 0, 0]
        ]

2) Adjacency matrix
      (two vertices are said to be adjacent
      if they are connected by an edge)
      1 means the vertices are connected by an edge
      0 means the vertices are NOT connected by an edge.
      2 means the vertices are connected by two edges

    v0 v1 v2
v0  1  2  1
v1  2  0  0
v2  1  0  0

adj = [
            [1, 2, 1],
            [2, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0]
      ]
