finite state automata (machines)
Machine M(S, I, f, s0, F)

S finite set of States
I finite set of (inputs) Alphabet 0, 1
f function f(Cstate, Cinput) = next state
s0 start state is: special state where execution starts
F set of final states

examples:
table for function f        start state s0; F = {s3}

      0      1
====================
s0   s1     s0
s1   s0     s3
s2   s0     s1
s3   s3     s3

A word made out the alphabet characters is said to be
ACCEPTED by the machine if it moves the machine from the
start to a final state.

Let L be the set of all words accepted by the machine.

I = {0, 1}

a) write a machine that accepts all words that start with 00
-> s0 -> 0 -> s1 -> 0 -> s2 -> 0, 1 -> s2
s0 -> 1 -> s3 -> 0, 1 -> s3 / s1 -> 1 -> s3 -> 0, 1 -> s3

b) write a machine that accepts all words that contain 00 somewhere
c) write a machine that accepts all words that that do NOT contain 00 somewhere
d) write a machine that accepts all strings that end with 00
e) write a machine that accepts strings that contain that least 2 0's

"accepted set of words is exactly what the discription is"
