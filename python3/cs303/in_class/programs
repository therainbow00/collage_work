    Due 3/18
    Plays the Monty Hall game 10000 times
    Each game hides a fabulous prize behind one door (pd)
    Then the "contestant" picks a door (cc)
    Then the contestant tries two stategies
       a) Keep (stick) the original pick.
       b) Switches to the door (nc) that is DIFFERENT
          from Monty's door (nc != md ) and DIFFERENT
	  from the first pick (nc!=cc)

    the program counts the number of wins
      from stategy a) cc==pd

    the program counts the number of wins
      from stategy b) nc==pd



The program prints out the number of wins that the first
stategy produces. And the number of wins that the second
stategy produces.

2. file: Bday.py
   Due 3/19
   There are 365 days in a year.
   There is a party (pre covid).
   Get the number of people at the party from the user.
   How many people do you need so that the probability is larger than
   0.5 that two of them have the same birthday?

   Get party size (pz) from the user.
   Repeat 1000 times:
     Make a party. That is
       Make a collection of pz birthdays
         note:  random.randint(1,365)   is a birthday
       If two numbers in the collection are equal,
       then two people have the same birthday and COUNT this collection

   When the loop ends, the count is the number of times that a party
   of size pz  has at least two people with the same Bday. The
   probability is   Count/1000   since there were 1000 parties.
   Print this value out.  Run the program with different sizes.  For
   what size does the probability become over 0.5?

3. Modular Arithmetic.  Below is the mod 5  (%5)  multiplication table.
   Due 3/19
         y

    * 0 1 2 3 4
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 2 3 4         entries:   (x*y)%5
 x  2 0 2 4 1 3
    3 0 3 1 4 2
    4 0 4 3 2 1

It should check that mod 5  multiplication is associative:

    a*(b*c) == (a*b)*c

    2  3 4      2 3  4
    2   2        1   4
      4            4

4. example: if a * b = 0, than at least one of a, b is also 0
    modular arithemetic mod 6

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    (2 * 3) % 6 = 0neither 2 nor 3 is 0

mod 7
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

1 * 7 = 7

if the modulus is a prime number, then  a * b = 0 means at least one
