Fake Directions (do this tomorrow on the real test):
            Log into Zoom.
            Turn on your computer camera.
            Log into your account on the cs server.
            This file,  ft1.txt, is in your home directory.
            Use nano or other file editor to  answer each
            question in ft1.txt. Save (Write) ft1.txt. 
            Exit the editor. You are Done.  See you Tuesday!

1) Reduce the fraction: a/b
a= 522910903; b= 507436351

>>> a= 522910903; b= 507436351
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
507436351 15474552
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
15474552 12250687
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
12250687 3223865
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
3223865 2579092
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
2579092 644773
>>> r=a%b; a=b; b=r; print(a,b)
644773 0
So we divide by 644773:
>>> 522910903//644773, 507436351//644773
(811, 787)

a/b = 811/787

2) Prove sqrt(11) is irrational.
Suppose it is a fraction: sqrt(11)= a/b  where a,b are 
positive whole numbers  with no common factors.

square both sides:   11 = a^2/b^2
mul by b^2:          11*b^2 = a^2
So                   11|a^2
Since 11 is prime:   11|a
So                   a = 11*c   (some integer c)
So                 11b^2 = 11*c*11*c
divide by 11:      b^2 = 11*c^2
Since 11 is prime  11|b
So 11 is a factor of both a and b.  Contradiction!
So sqrt(11) is NOT a fraction





3) Use Mathematical Induction to show that:

     S(n):  1+2+4+...+2^n = 2^(n+1) -1

   is true for all integers, n,  n>=0.

Base case:  S(0):   1 = 2^1 - 1
                      = 2 - 1
                      = 1

Induction:  Show if S(n-1) is true, then S(n) is true.

S(n-1):    1+2+4+...+2^(n-1) = 2^n -1.
The left hand side of S(n) is the left hand side of S(n-1) plus
the term 2^n.  Since S(n-1) is true, we can simplify the left hand
side of S(n):

1+2+4+...+2^n
2^n - 1 + 2^n

Since there are two 2^n, we simplify:
2*2^n - 1
Which is:
2^1*2^n - 1
Rule add exponents of a common base (2)
2^(1+n) - 1
Swapping the addition:
2^(n+1) - 1
which is the the right hand side of S(n).  Proved!



FORMULAS

1+2+3+...+n = (n^2+n)/2
1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2
2+4+6+...+(2n) = n^2 + n
