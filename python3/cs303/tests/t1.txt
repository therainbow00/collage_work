303                        TEST 1             Mar 05/2021



Directions:
            Log into Zoom.
            Turn on your computer camera.
            Log into your account on the cs server.
            This file,  t1.txt, is in your home directory.
            Use nano or other file editor to  answer each
            question in t1.txt. Save (Write) t1.txt.
            Exit the editor. You are Done.  See you Tuesday!

1) Reduce the fraction: a/b
a= 514358939; b= 508555171

a = 3627355
b = 2176413
r = 1450942

a = 2176413
b = 1450942
r = 725471

a = 1450942
b = 725471
r = 0

answer: a/b = 709/701

2) Prove sqrt(3) is irrational.

sqrt(3) = a / b
3 = a^2 / b^2
3 * b^2 = a^2
3 | a^2
3 | (a * a)
3 | a

a = 3 * c

3 * b^2 = a^2
3 * b^2 = (3 * c) * (3 * c)
3 * b^2 = 9 * c^2
b^2 = 3 * c^2
3 | b^2
3 | (b * b)
3 | b



3) Use Mathematical Induction to show that:

     S(n):  5+7+9+...+(2*n+3) = n^2 + 4*n

   is true for all integers, n,  n>0.

   5 = 2n + 3       7 = 2(2) + 3
   5 = 2(1) + 3     7 = 4 + 3
   5 = 2 + 3        7 = 7
   5 = 5

   5 = (1)^2 + 4(1) 5 + 7 = (2)^2 + 4(2)
   5 = 1 + 4        5 + 7 = 4 + 8
   5 = 5            12 = 12

   n^2 + 4n + 2(n + 1) + 3 = (n + 1)^2 + 4(n + 1)
   n^2 + 4n + 2n + 2 + 3 = (n + 1)(n + 1) + 4n + 4
                           (n^2 + n + n + 1) + 4n + 4
   n^2 + 4n + 2n + 5 = (n^2 + 2n + 1) + 4n + 4
   n^2 + 6n + 5 = n^2 + 6n + 5

   answer: n^2 + 6n + 5 = n^2 + 6n + 5



FORMULAS

1+2+3+...+n = (n^2+n)/2
1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2
2+4+6+...+(2n) = n^2 + n

Directions.  For problems 4 and 5 below write a formulas in terms of n
             for the number of STEPs executed.



4. for i in range(n):
     for j in range(n):
       for j in range(3):
         STEP
answer: 3n^2


5.  for k in range(1,n+1):
      for j in range(k):
        STEP

        N   STEPs
    2^0 1     1
    2^1 2     2
        3     3
    2^2 4     4
    2^3 8     8

    answer: (n^2 + n) / 2


6.  Arrays as binary trees.

    Given array, A,  below:

value: X 10 60 50 35 25 45 30 21 23
index: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
note: A[1]=10,  A[8]=21, A[9]=23

a) How many numbers are stored in the tree?
answer: 9

b) How many levels does the tree have?
answer: 3 levels

c) How many nodes are in the bottom level?
answer: 2 nodes

value: X 10 60 50 35 25 45 30 21 23
index: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

                        (60)1
            (35)2                          (50)3
    (23)4             (25)5           (45)6    (30)7
(21)8     (10)9

answer: value: X 60 35 50 23 25 45 30 21 10
        index: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
