/**
 * A brief reminder of how command line arguments work.  The number of white-
 * space separated words (including the command word) that are present on the
 * command line is given by argc (ARGument Count), and each word is in the
 * NULL terminated array of strings argv (ARGument Vector), argv[0] is always
 * the command itself.
 *
 * You should always check argc to make sure you have enough words to do what
 * you want to do with argv, before you attempt to do anything with argv, or
 * you may cause a segmentation fault attempting trying to access beyond the
 * valid range of the argv array.
