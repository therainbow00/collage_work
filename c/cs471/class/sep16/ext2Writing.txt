To write to a file on an ext2 image:

0. Read the data from the source file.
1. Parse the path of the destination.
     path: /etc/xyz/abc.txt
     find: etc will be in the root directory
           xyz in the /etc directory
           create a file named abc.txt in the xyz directory
2. Find a free block (use the block bitmap)
3. Find a free inode (use the inode bitmap)
4. Append a new entry to the xyz directory.
      - inode number ( 4 bytes )
      - record length ( 2 bytes )
      - name length ( 1 bytes )
      - type (will always be 1)
      - compute length of the record: 8 + name length (round up to a multiple
        of 4)
5. Update the  block and inode bitmaps
6. Store data in the block that you found (step 2)
7. Fill in the inode data.
      - permissions (0644 + file flag)
      - size
      - dates (mtime)
      - number of blocks (512 bytes blocks -- 2*1)
      - store the block that was allocated in the blocks array (the one with
        15 elements)
      - user and group id  ( getuid() and getgid() )
      - links count = 1

List of modules (Python):

1. struct pack (same as unpack, but for writing)
2. time
3. os ( getuid, getgid )
