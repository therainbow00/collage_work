/** 1pt
 * Complete the main function to:
 *  - Print a prompt that says: "Input a hex number: " (no newline at the end)
 *    - The number may be a 32 bit unsigned integer ('unsigned int' type)
 *    - Same as from h2.c
 *  - Print the input value in binary by making a loop over the values 31 down
 *    to 0 and (i.e. decreasing):
 *    - Test each bit in the value read against (1<<i) where i is the current
 *      loop value.  (Binary lesson 1)
 *    - Use a if statement in the loop to print a 1 or a 0 depending on what
 *      the test above produces. (C lesson 2)
 *  - Print the newline after the loop, not inside of the loop.
