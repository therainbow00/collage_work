 * Complete the following program:
 *  - Complete bittest in the same manner as h4.c
 *  - Complete printbinary that uses bittest and a loop similar to the one used in
 *    h3.c to print the value given by 'num' in binary (printbinary should _not_
 *    print a newline at the end however.
 *  - Complete main to print:
 *    - print for i ranging from 0 to 31 the binary value for a 1 shifted to
 *      position i, to be displayed in both binary and then decimal.
 *      Prefix the values with the bit position.
