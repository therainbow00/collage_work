Complete each .c file and make them into working programs.  Run the working
version in the working/ sub-directory to fully understand how the program should
operate. Example: './working/p1' from this directory would run the working
version of the p1 program.

Use the 'make' program to build the programs:

 make		<- Attempts to build all the programs
 make p#	<- Attempts to just build p# (where # is 1-5)
 make clean	<- Removes all programs and .o files

Use the handin program to check your work.  You can run the 'check' program
from this directory or use 'handin --check h1a' from your home directory.

When you have completed some work, use handin to submit your assignment.  You
can do this as many times as you like and should do it early and often.  To do
this, from your home directory, use:

 handin h1a
