CS351 Assignment #8 (10 points)

Complete each C file.  Do not modify the existing main functions. Data for the
p2 and p3 problems (and optionally p1) is provided as the data file in the data
directory.

Each problem should use one or more of the malloc/calloc/realloc/reallocarray
functions.

Working examples are found in the working/ directory.  Test you programs
against the output of the working versions or with the check program.
