/*
  Programming concept: functions

  Program should:      create functions convert_temperature, convert_distance, convert_weight with each one converting between English and metric units (F and C, miles and km, pounds and kg).  Each function should take two parameters - one is a number and one is the unit converting from (e.g., "F" or "kg").  In main, ask the user for a number, ask the user what unit they want to convert from, use if's to call the appropriate conversion function, and print the result.
