Do something fun in curses.

Can you work with a partner?  Sure.

How many points?  Some.

The map.c and ball.c files in this directory were copied from
  /u1/junk/curses
as starting points.

Start with one of those and decide what you want it to do.  Let
me know in Teams what you are planning on, and I can say "ok" and
give suggestions on how to get started.

Also, the man pages.

Some possibilities
(And I may update with more thoughts as people decide)...


** map.c **

+ larger map

+ more than one character moving around

+ read map from a file

+ multiple maps and getting to the right place in the map gets you to the next level

+ stepping onto certain spaces (e.g., $ or M) makes something happen - you get coins, fight a monster, etc.

+ things that could happen...
  - get coins
  - arithmetic quiz
  - quiz on something
  - guess the outcome of random die roll

+ pretty map - add colors

+ monsters that move back and forth


** ball.c **

+ have ball go at an angle and bounce in a reasonable way

+ multiple balls (added automatically or by user pressing something)

+ pretty balls - add colors, make more than one character

+ world - print something nice as a background

+ add a paddle, have ball interact with it

+ make ball respond to gravity, not just bouncing up/down forever

+ user presses key to start/stop/pause ball

+ firefowrks - ball explodes



** covid.c

See OneNote notebook, h12, for sources of data about covid.  There is data for
ISU, Vigo County, Indiana, US, the world.  There are different data sources for
the same type of data for some things like # cases and deaths.

Take a look and see if there is anything that looks interesting.  If you have
something else in mind that you wanted to look at let me know.

Some thoughts of things that would be interesting to me...
(Note - I would help with these.)

+ Pull latest data automatically

+ Display latest data from multipole difference sources

+ Look up requested date(s) and location(s)

+ Look up the highest location for a given date

+ Look for hot spots, where there is/was a steep increase

+ Look at whether any of the early predictors for spikes work (doctor's visits, google searchs, cell phone movement)

+ Demographics of cases and deaths in a requested region and/or date(s)
