Two types of threads:
  1. sender (ids 0 to 9)
  2. receiver (ids 0 to 9)

10 of each.

Global variable:

unsigned int flags = 0;

At some time after start, the sender doing something.

   print the time in nanoseconds

   set a bit in a word indicating that it has printed the time (it's done)
   flags |= (1 << id)   where id is the id of the sender

The receiver waits until the sender indicates that it's done,
then it prints the time.

   to check if the sender is done, the receiver must ask if

      flags & ( 1 << id) is zero or not

Flags must be protected by a mutex.

printf("S %2d %12ld\n", id, getnanoseconds());
printf("R %2d %12ld\n", id, getnanoseconds());
