1. Buddy System (bit operation practice)
    Will give scenario and some change:

Given Buddy Table, Min Block Size 2, and 8 bytes of Memory available.

       pid      address       size
        23            0          4
        34            4          2
         0            6          2

Process 34 exits, give the new table.


       pid      address       size
        23            0          4
         0            4          4

Example 2:

       total size 16 bytes
       min block size 2 bytes

       pid      address       size
         0            0         16

process 25 begins and wants 5 bytes

       pid      address       size
        25            0          8
         0            8          8

process 26 begins and wants 7 bytes

       pid      address       size
        25            0          8
        26            8          8

process 25 exits

       pid      address       size
         0            0          8     addr=0000 size=1000 xor=1000
        26            8          8

process 27 begins and wants 1 bytes

       pid      address       size
        27            0          2    addresses 0 1
         0            2          2    addresses 2 3
         0            4          4    addresses 4 5 6 7
        26            8          8    addresses 8 to 15

process 29 begins and wants 3 bytes

       pid      address       size
        27            0          2    addresses 0 1
         0            2          2    addresses 2 3
        29            4          4    addresses 4 5 6 7
        26            8          8    addresses 8 to 15

pid 27 exits

       pid      address       size
         0            0          4   0000 ^ 0100 = 0100
        29            4          4
        26            8          8

2. File systems (ext2).

     How it works.

     Execute: chmod +r filename.txt

     What needs to be done to change the access permissions?

     a. Find filename.txt in current directory
     b. Get the inode number from the entry for filename.txt
     c. Go to the inode table, and find the inode.
     d. Update the mode (i_mode) field in the inode.
        
     What changes?

     20 points (10 points each)

     a. i_mode field in the inode
     b. m_time field (last time the inode was changed)
     c. a_time field (last time the inode was accessed)

3. Concurrent/semaphore programming.  Complexity <= boat problem.


4. Building red/black trees.

     Given a scenario.

     Insert X.
